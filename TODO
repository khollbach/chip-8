[x] Pass the Quirks test for CHIP-8
[x] Pass the Keypad test
[ ] figure out terminal weirdness (see below)

---

Keyboard tests work in Kitty terminal, but only on the second time. Maybe related to the fact that we're not reseting everything about the terminal?
Update: now that we're resetting terminal config correctly, the required steps are:
1. run an instance of the emulator
2. `killall chip-8` to kill it without resetting the terminal
    (?)
3. run it a second time (and then it seems to work)
