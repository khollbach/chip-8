[ ] Pass the Quirks test for CHIP-8
[ ] Pass the Keypad test
    (1 and 2 seem fine; 3 (getkey) says "X; not halting")

Keyboard tests work in Kitty terminal, but only on the second time. Maybe related to the fact that we're not reseting everything about the terminal? Look into this...

Terminal weirdness when after exiting. Seems like we're not fully reseting the state of the terminal? to-do: look into this.
