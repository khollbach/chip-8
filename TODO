    TODOs

[x] Pass the Quirks test for CHIP-8
[ ] Pass the Keypad test
    (1 and 2 seem fine; 3 (getkey) says "X; not halting")

NOTE (left off here!)

The keypad test seems to have uncovered a bug in our timer implementation:
* when we're blocking waiting for a key relase (get_key) we don't tick down the delay timer register!
TODO: make sure you understand the issue, and the desired behaviour; then think about how to fix it.

Low-priority terminal-related non-sense:

Keyboard tests work in Kitty terminal, but only on the second time. Maybe related to the fact that we're not reseting everything about the terminal? Look into this...

Terminal weirdness when after exiting. Seems like we're not fully reseting the state of the terminal? to-do: look into this.

Ctrl+c doesn't take effect unless the program polls input... how to fix?
